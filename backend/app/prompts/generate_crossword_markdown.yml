  Using the following words with their coordinates and directions, create a crossword grid in markdown format.

  Words data:
  {words_data}

  Requirements:
  - The crossword grid must be exactly 10×10 cells.
  - All words must fit entirely inside the 10×10 grid. Do not allow any word to go beyond the grid boundaries.
  - Each word must be placed so that it starts and ends within the grid.
  - Arrange the words so that vertical and horizontal words intersect at common letters wherever possible. For example, if the word "CAT" (vertical) and "BAT" (horizontal) share the letter "A", they should intersect at this letter in the grid.
  - Do not simply stack words; ensure that vertical and horizontal words intersect at shared letters whenever possible.
  - Before drawing the grid, for each word, specify the starting cell (row, column), direction (across/down), and at which letter it intersects with other words (if any).
  - Number each word’s starting cell according to the list provided.

  Prepare two grid versions in markdown:
  - A completed grid with all the letters filled in.
  - An empty grid with only the numbers for starting positions; other cells should be blank or use ⬜.

  Use this markdown table format:
  |    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
  | 1  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 2  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 3  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 4  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 5  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 6  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 7  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 8  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 9  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 10 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |

  Additional rules:
  - Do not use words longer than 6 letters. If the word is longer, leave it out.
  - Do not leave any part of a word outside the grid.
  - Do not allow any words to be split or truncated.
  - If word is not fit the rules, leave it out.
  - All words must be fully inside the grid, without any overflow or misplacement.

  Example of correct intersections:

  |    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
  | 1  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 2  |   |   | B |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 3  |   | C | A | T |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 4  |   |   | T |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 5  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 6  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 7  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 8  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 9  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |
  | 10 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |

  At the end, provide the list of clues with their numbers and directions. Double-check that all words fit perfectly inside the grid and that the cell count is correct.
